# Ping - A Simple Reminder App for Android
Ping (formerlly Remember for Android) is a simple and quick reminder app that will create a Persistant Notification on your device
at a specified time. Unlike most Reminder apps, this one is made for quick access, and quick use rather than long lists or long 
recurring reminders.
