# A Simple Reminder App for Android
Remember is a simple and quick reminder app that will create a Persistant Notification on your device. Unlike most Reminder apps, this one is made for quick access, and quick use rather than long lists or long 
recurring reminders. This app is also in the process of being rewritten as "Ping", but may not be completed in time due to college and 
other projects.
